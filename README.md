Feel free to use this, as this is basically following this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY). 
I express my greatest gratitude to Andrej.

However, I have added plenty of my own notes in there, hopefully this helps you to understand the video and code better.

## Play around with the hyperparams too! 
- normally the n_embd should be 384 
- the n_layer should be 6 
- I have a bad gpu let me be
